Here's what the guide includes:  
📋 Complete Guide Structure:  

- 📋 Planning & Prerequisites - Backup strategies, tools, and safety protocols
- 🔧 Drive Preparation & Partitioning - Setting up optimal drive configuration
- 👤 User Profile Migration - Moving user folders with symbolic links
- 🐳 Docker & Container Migration - Relocating Docker to D: and E: drives
- 🐧 WSL2 Environment Migration - Moving distributions and configuring data links
- 🤖 OLLAMA & FABRIC Configuration - Setting up AI tools across drives
- 🎯 Master Execution Plan - Complete automation and validation framework

🎯 Key Features:  

- Mermaid diagrams with styled backgrounds and clear process flows
- Autonomous sections - each can be executed independently
- Comprehensive validation - safety checks at every step
- Rollback procedures - emergency recovery scripts included
- Performance optimization - SSD/SATA distribution for optimal speed
- Complete automation - master script to orchestrate entire migration

💾 Final Configuration:  

- C: Drive (SSD 4TB) → Minimal boot drive with OS and applications
- D: Drive (SSD 4TB) → Development runtime (WSL2, Docker, OLLAMA cache, FABRIC)
- E: Drive (SATA 8TB) → User data and storage (profiles, volumes, models, projects)

> The guide includes detailed PowerShell scripts, validation procedures, and a master execution plan that can run the entire migration automatically while providing safety checkpoints and rollback capabilities. Each section is self-contained and contributes to the complete solution without duplication.
